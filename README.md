# Stargaze
this repo is me trying to create a chess bot to defeat my friend in chess (he is 1200 elo). we have a bet of a chocolate bar.

I thought I just could create a _basic_ C++ code for the engine buuuut I soon found out that even finding legal moves in a position is really hard. So I'm going to use [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) and [chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com). These are really cool so do go check them out. I can't probably do what they can do even with 10% efficiency.

I plan to create a UCI compliant chess engine using C++ to improve my C++ skills.
